                <p id="p1"><span class="menu1">Ham & Eggs</span>The difference between involvement and 
                    commitment is like ham and eggs. The chicken is involved; the pig is committed.

                <p id="p2"><span class="menu2">Fried Chicken</span>Everyone loves fried chicken, Don't ever make it. Ever. Buy it from a 
                    place that makes good fried chicken. Nora Ephron</p>

                    wrap their minds around is that those hens will eventually end up on the dinner table.</p>
