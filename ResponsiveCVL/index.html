                <p>Ad technology is ruining the web as dubious websites game traffic to take advantage of the algorithms
                    the ad tech companies use to place ads, according to a paper out from Kalkis Research, a French research
                    firm. News organizations, desperate for traffic, feed into the system by using systems such as Taboola
                    and Outbrain which often link to these shell sites, the report says. (<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org">Web source here</a>)</p>

                <h2>2</h2>
                <p>These traffic brokers are designed to game the advertising industry’s metrics. Most of their visitors
                    are sent to low-end websites. But if you happen to be of high value to the ad tech industry (based on
                    your IP), you’ll be redirected through a loop of various shell websites, spending a fraction of a second
                    on each, in order to increase the apparent quality of these websites’ audience. Once the shell websites
                    in the network have good enough Alexa rankings, and off-the-chart demographics, they sign contracts to
                    display ads with much better terms. (<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org">Web source here</a>)</p>

            <div class="column">
                <h2>3</h2>
                <p>We’ve spent a couple of days looking investigating the links Taboola displays on its banners. They are
                    surprisingly uncorrelated to the webpage’s content, or the user’s IP. Worst of all, around half of them
                    lead to “traffic arbitrage” wannabes: shell websites with stale and generic content, filled with ads and
                    clickbait (table below). Some of them seem to be outright fraud, as there’s no way they could have CPRs
                    high enough to eek out a profit after paying at least 3 cents per visitor to Taboola.
