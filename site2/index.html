        <h1>The place where you can read about cooking and eating!</h1>

        <p>Do you like or even <strong>LOVE</strong> talking about or reading about <strong>cooking and eating</strong>??
        I will periodically share recipes, tips, and cooking stories here!</p>
    <br>
        <p>Here's a webpage with the recipe for a very flavorful and aromatic Anisette from one of my favorite chefs!

        <p>I've learned the most excellent value and sanity of using <a href="https://www.github.com">GITHUB</a>!
        I also like the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validations Service web page</a>!
        </p>
        <p>What if I told you that web page devs can view their webpages through the eyes of a person with 
            cognitive disabilities, dyslexia, motor skills disabilities, or vision impairment? Well, you can do
            all of that with this webpage, <a href="https://www.funkify.org/simulators/?v=f003c44deab6">
            Funkify Simulators</a>!

            <tr><td>Mercury</td><td>Venus</td><td>Earth</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Mars</td><td>Jupiter</td><td>Saturn</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Uranus</td><td>Neptune</td><td>Pluto</td></tr>
