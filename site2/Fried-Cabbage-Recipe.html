        <p>This is a very <strong>flavorful</strong> cabbage dish that has <strong>BACON</strong> in it and is very simple
            and easy to make!</p>
        <blockquote><p>"This is one of those dishes that should be made and consumed on the same day as it doesn't do
            very well as leftovers! If you have a <strong>cast iron skillet</strong> large enough (12" or larger), use it to 
            prepare this recipe! P.S. There's bacon in this!!"</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>6 - 8 strips of bacon (more if you like, but don't over do it) Hahaha!</li>
            <li>1 head red or green cabbage - sliced (note: red cabbage is a tad sweeter and makes the dish more 
                interesting)</li>
            <li>1 diced onion (I prefer yellow or red, again for the more complex flavors.)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken broth (canned is fine, but if you have some homemade left over from a roast chicken, even 
                better)</li>
            <li>1 tsp good cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp to 1 tsp fresh ground pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry bacon in cast iron skillet until crispy. (Do not sample unless you made more than you need.)</li>
            <li>Drain Bacon, crumble and set aside.</li>
            <li>Fry onion until golden, then place cabbage into skillet on medium heat. Cook until cabbage is wilted.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle whatever crumbled bacon is left into the skillet. Add the chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 10 minutes (no lid please!)</li>
            <li>Serve with a nice India Pale Ale!</li>
        </ol>
