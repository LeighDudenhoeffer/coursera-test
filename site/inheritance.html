        <h1>Cascade of CSS Example</h1>
        <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
        <p>Inheritance allows us to write more global styles on parent elements and then "fine-tune" the styles for some of 
            the child elements as needed. Such approach makes writing CSS very efficient.</p>
        <h2 style="color: green;">Subheading 2</h2>  
        <p>While we can't take all of our wisdom from just a few choice words, or even choice sentences, there's just something 
            about a perfectly phrased quote that can open our minds and our hearts, causing us to think and feel things we may not 
            have even thought possible before.</p>
