        <h1>Two Column Layout Design</h1>

        <div>
            <p id="p1">“Just take my hand, lead, dance with me...and I will simply follow the blueness 
                of the water, the white waves rolling free...where the earth beneath my feet and stars 
                make my heart whole again...in long and priceless moments of shared solitude...”
                ― Oksana Rus</p>
            <p id="p2">“The road may be long, tortuous and wearied. But the resulting success is 
                enduring, sure and sweet. The fool abandons hope in the wearied journey of life. The 
                wise gets going - holding firmly to the promise of a better tomorrow. He that gives up 
                too soon fails to understand that life rewards with success only those who cling on to 
                hope against hope. Those who hope when it is unfashionable to hope.”
                ― Abiodun Fijabi</p>
