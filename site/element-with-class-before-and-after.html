        from this webpage (https://mostlywesterns.com/top-20-john-wayne-movie-quotes/)
        I’m sure we’ve all got our own favorite lines from John Wayne movies, and hopefully, I’ve included a few of them in this list of 20 John Wayne’s movie quotes.
        
        For an appreciation of John Wayne quotes this time, not from the movies but said in his own words about actors, directors, etc. there is another 15.
        
        Having watched so many of Duke’s films over the last couple of years I made a note of some of the quotes, other than the more famous examples, that I thought might be appreciated by genuine JW fans. I’ve listed them chronologically rather than by personal preference.
        
        ‘You may need me and this Winchester, Curly’
        ‘You’re the guy we’re fighting this war for’ 
        ‘Get down off them horses. I don’t favor looking up to the likes of you’
        ‘Never apologize, mister, it’s a sign of weakness’
