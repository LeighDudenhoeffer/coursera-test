                <p>Additionally, it's very important to note the 4 types of links (see below)!</p> <!--ditto above-->
            </div>

            <h2>The 4 types of links:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Absolute Reference: links to a fully formed URL and needs http or https</li>
                <!--Ex. <a href="page2.html">Second Page</a> Also, your page should NEVER link to local folders-->
                <li>Relative Reference: links to a file or a folder. Also used to call an ID tag</li>
                <!--The id tag would refer to another location/folder inside the same file-->
                <!--Ex. <a href="docs/page2.html">Second Page<?a>-->
                <li>Internal Links: links that go from one page on a domain to a different page on the same domain.</li>
                <!--Ex. -->
                <li>Graphical Links: links that are "clickable" icons or images. The clickable component doesn't need to be text.</li>
            </ol>

        <!-- Span -->
