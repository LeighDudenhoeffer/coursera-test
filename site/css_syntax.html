        <h1>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h1>
        <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
        <p>CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should
            be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
        </p>
        <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
        <p>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but 
            occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial 
            example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But 
            who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
            or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
