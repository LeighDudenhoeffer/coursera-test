            &quot;It's not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
            or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who's
            actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust, sweat, and blood; who strives valiantly;
            who errs, who comes short again and again, because there's no effort without error and 
            shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the
            great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the 
            triumph of high achievement, and who a the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring
            greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know
            victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.&quot; <!--the &nbsp tends to be misused when they want to make a space-->

        <!--learned how to properly place quotes and ampersands, etc.-->
