    <p>The process of writing an essay usually begins with the close reading of a text. Of course, 
        the writer's personal experience may occasionally come into the essay, and all essays depend on the writer's 
        own observations and knowledge. But most essays, especially academic essays, begin with a close reading of some 
        kind of text—a painting, a movie, an event—and usually with that of a written text. When you close read, you 
        observe facts and details about the text. You may focus on a particular passage, or on the text as a whole. Your 
        aim may be to notice all striking features of the text, including rhetorical features, structural elements, 
        cultural references; or, your aim may be to notice only selected features of the text—for instance, oppositions 
        and correspondences, or particular historical references. Either way, making these observations constitutes the 
        first step in the process of close reading.</p>
